For use in printing bills in a pre-paid auto counter outside a railway station, a Rails application needs to be build.

The user should be able to select a pre entered list of auto numbers, a pre entered list of places for 'From' and 'To' and the fare needs to be calculated based on the following rules : -

- First 1.5kms 20 Rs
- Rs. 10/- for every 1Km after 1.5Kms

The receipt should be displayed with a alpha-numeric code called the Receipt ID, distance between the places, From and To locations and the amount calculated. All Receipt IDs should be generated unique.
