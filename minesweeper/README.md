Minesweeper
===========
The classical game of minesweeper played in the console

Part 1
------
Use object oriented concepts where-ever possible 

- create 10x10 minesweeper board
- preload mines in specific cells
- ask user to enter the cell position to open as x,y
- open the cell based on user input 
- game over when the user clicks on a mine
- 'o' represents open cell, 'x' represents unopened cell, a mine is represented by '@' 
- use colorize gem for text and background colors
- run the sample minesweeper.rb file to see the expected display


Installing colorize
----------
`gem install colorize`

In the source file require the gem as
```ruby
require 'colorize' 
```
