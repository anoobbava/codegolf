Store the marks(in 100) obtained by students of a class in Physics in a single Array
All data (state of the system) should be saved in a single array of the following format:

```
 [ [name1, mark1], [name2, mark2], [name3, mark3]... ]
```

The name of a student is saved as [firstName secondName], like "Neetha Padmanabhan"

- add a new student and mark to the string
- print the list of students and their marks
- get the mark of a student given her name, from this string
- given the name of a student delete the student and her mark
- replace all the names by just their first name.
- get the list of all names whose mark is greater than 70
- print all the students and their marks in the descending order of their marks
