Store the marks(in 100) obtained by students of a class in Physics in a single Array
All data (state of the system) should be saved in a single array of the following format:

```
 [ [name1, mark1], [name2, mark2], [name3, mark3]... ]
```

The name of a student is saved as [firstName secondName], like "Neetha Padmanabhan"

  a. add a new student and mark to the string
  b. print the list of students and their marks
  c. get the mark of a student given her name, from this string
  d. given the name of a student delete the student and her mark
  e. replace all the names by just their first name.
  f. get the list of all names whose mark is greater than 70
  g. print all the students and their marks in the descending order of their marks
